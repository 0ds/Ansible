  Synopsis:-
    The expect module executes a command and responds to prompts.
    The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be processed through the shell, so variables like $HOME and operations like "<", ">", "|", and "&" will not work.


2. shell – Execute commands in nodes.
3. raw – Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command
