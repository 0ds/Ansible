                                                   bcoz, >>> I found in its Github issue that pip 10 no longer uninstalls 
                                                   distutils packages. So I downgraded to pip 8.1.1. And now it works. <<<
$ sudo pip install python --upgrade
$ sudo pip install molecule docker   -----------> if u also want docker images for deployment testing use "docker driver to install"
